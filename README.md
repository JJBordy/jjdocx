# jjdocx
Library to create .doc/.docx documents based on your templates and data.
The goal is to have an open source, free solution to alter the damn docx/doc documents.

Will be in Java 8 (since it is still widely used), aims to not use any other dependencies, hopes to become a Maven repository.
Once it will be close to version 1, will look for contributors to make a proper stable version 1.

Currently is in conceiving phase, nothing to use, nothing to see...

In version 1, for doc/docx, will be able to:
* replace keywords
* replace/create paragraphs
* add table rows
* generate a simple html page with all the template tags for those who will create the templates

In version 2 it will be able to create complex tables, and combine templates in templates.
