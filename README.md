# jjdocx
Library to create .doc/.docx documents based on your templates and data

Currently it is just bootstrapping it.

In version 1 it will be able to:
* replace keywords
* replace/create paragraphs
* create simple table rows
* generate a simple html page with all the template tags for those who will create the templates

In version 2 it will be able to create complex tables, and combine templates in templates.

The goal is to have an open source, free solution to alter the damn docx/doc documents.
